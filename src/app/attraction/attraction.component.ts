      Title: "Piazza della Signoria (Signoria Square)",
      Text: "If one had to choose images that best represented Florence, very probably two would come to mind: Brunelleschi’s spectacular dome, a fixture of Florentine iconography, along with that which is considered one of the most beautiful squares in all of Italy: Piazza della Signoria. \n\n The unusual “L-shaped” piazza owes its form to a series of historical events starting from the second half of the 13th century. At that time, two warring factions, the Guelphs and the Ghibellines were fighting it out all over Florence. And when the Guelphs finally took control, they razed 36 houses and towers of their rivals to the ground: on the so-called “damned” land, it was forbidden to build a single thing and salt was thrown all over the ground so that not even a blade of grass would grow. \n\nEver since the early times when Florence began building that active and enterprising community that would characterize its long history, Piazza della Signoria has always been the symbol of civic life in the city, as opposed to the religious center which grew up around the cathedral.\n\n  This piazza, alternating emblem of both republican government and of the grand dukes, tells glorious stories of Florence through its fascinating architecture and its exceptional works of art. It was the scene of important events and even executions, such as that of the Dominican brother Girolamo Savonarola, hanged and burned right here on May 23, 1498, as a granite slab in the pavement reminds us, almost in the middle of the piazza.",

      Title: "Florence Cathedral: Santa Maria del Fiore",
      Text: "With its huge, almost outsized, bulk, the Florence cathedral, Santa Maria del Fiore, makes its presence felt, framed by the spectacular surroundings of the religious center of the city, complete with the Baptistry and Giotto’s bell tower. When it was finished, in the 1400s, it was the largest church in Europe, and today it is the fifth largest, behind Saint Peter’s, Saint Paul’s in London, the cathedral of Seville and that of Milan. \n\nIt’s the result of 170 years of work as well as the combined, impassioned efforts of many generations of artists and architects. What you see today is the product of an endless series of transformations: enlargements, additions and modifications that have given life to one of the most exciting stories ever in the history of art. \n\n At the end of the 13th century, Florence is the main actor in a story of expansion without precedent, backed by a rich and enterprising middle class. The population grows quickly and the city has five times the square area of its ancient walls. With the construction of the Palazzo Vecchio, a new civic center is taking shape, and in the religious center of town, the final decoration work is being finished on the Baptistry of Saint John. But the city still doesn’t have a cathedral worthy of its prestige: the old church dedicated to Santa Reparata can’t bear the comparison with the nearby Baptistry and anyway, it’s become too small to contain the numerous population of the faithful.\n\n So, on September 8, 1296, in front of a festive crowd, the first stone is solemnly placed and the new construction site is begun. The work has been entrusted to Arnolfo di Cambio, the great architect who is redesigning the new face of Gothic Florence. As Giorgio Vasari wrote, “Nothing of importance was considered without his consent”. Arnolfo was directing both the building site of Palazzo Vecchio and that of the church of Santa Croce at the same time. He certainly must have been held in great respect since, for his contributions to the city, Florence decided to waive tax payments from him.",

      Title: "Basilica of Santa Croce",
      Text: "The Florentine church of Santa Croce holds many world records. It is the largest Franciscan church built in the Middle Ages – together with its important convent – and is one of the finest examples of Italian Gothic. At the beginning of the Renaissance, it was already a famous theological school – among its students was the young Dante Alighieri, during his formative literary years. \n\nIn the large convent, some of the most authoritative personalities of the political, artistic and literary worlds were offered hospitality; over time, Santa Croce has turned into a true Pantheon of national glory – over 15,000 people are buried there, among them Michelangelo, Niccolò Machiavelli, Galileo Galilei but also famous names from modern times such as Enrico Fermi and Guglielmo Marconi. And, of course, the basilica was an exceptional artistic workshop in which labored the most celebrated names in the world of art. \n\nOver its seven centuries of history, the church became wealthy with the donations of rich families that obtained the privilege of being buried in its numerous chapels. Today, its artistic patrimony is truly amazing and attracts almost a million visitors a year.\n\nOriginally, the exterior look of the church was rather modest, with the brown stone facade almost devoid of decoration, in line with the model widely used in 12th century Florence. But the apparent simplicity hid a much more spectacular aspect as soon as one entered: the structure recalled the ancient Roman paleochristian basilicas but the dimensions were decidedly more monumental and overwhelming and represented a real challenge to the technical abilities of the time.\n\n Its original design of 1294 is traditionally attributed to Arnolfo di Cambio, the great architect and mind behind Florence’s makeover at the end of the 13th century. The Florentine republic footed the bill, according to the custom of the time, since great churches not only glorified saints but also celebrated the prestige of the city’s powerful middle class. The Franciscans decided to replace the original little church with a real cathedral, going against the principals of their own order that demanded humility and simplicity even in architectural forms.",

      Title: "Loggia dei Lanzi",
      Text: "Despite its somewhat removed position with respect to the square, the arcade called “Loggia della Signoria”, known also as the Loggia dei Lanzi, is one of the city’s major points of interest and prestige. Created as a roof to host popular assemblies in the open air, this space has since been transformed into an exceptional outdoor museum when, during the 1500s, certain masterpieces of sculpture were exhibited here. This fascinating place, like a fence that protects a crowd of immobile actors, exerts an irresistible attraction and wherever you are in the piazza, you can’t help but walk over and take a look inside.    \n\nThe arcade takes its name from the Landsknechts (Lanzichenecchi in Italian) the infamous mercenary corp that bivouacked under these arches before moving on to ransack Rome in 1527. It was designed by Simone Talenti in late Gothic style towards the end of the 1300s, but his use of round arches makes it one of the first examples of Renaissance architecture in Florence; it seems that even Brunelleschi was inspired by it for the design of what is considered to be the first fully Renaissance building, the “Spedale degli Innocenti”. \n\nThe aspects of its architecture are elegant and essential. In the upper portion of the facade, the four medallions between the wide arches represent the cardinal virtues. The terrace above the Loggia, now part of the Uffizi Gallery, was created by Bernardo Buontalenti to allow the people to watch ceremonies being held in the piazza from above. Today, it is part of the museum bar and is a perfect spot to catch a panoramic view. \n\nTwo stone lions – one from ancient Rome, the other from the 17th century – seem to guard the entrance from the sides of the stairway. Their presence, at the same time menacing and reassuring, gives the impression of entering a sacred place.\n\nThe loggia contains several ancient masterworks. Patroclus and Menelaus, copy of an original Greek statue, are from the Flavian era, and the six female figures on the back wall probably come from Trajan’s Forum in Rome and were part of the decorative scheme of Villa Medici. Two of these, made out of rare marble, surely represent two matrons of a high, perhaps imperial social level. \n\nIn the second half of the 16th century, Cosimo I de’ Medici ordered the Loggia changed into a sort of sculptors workshop, a place where one could admire great works of art. The idea was also a political one: the sculptures were to celebrate the definitive victory of the Granduchy over the republican institutions of the city. So the loggia truly became an exhibition space reserved for sculpture and, as open-air museum, is the only place that you can visit free. Every statue here had to symbolize some part of Florence’s history, each, of course, with its own precise political reference.\n\nIn 1850, a thermometer and a barometer were attached to the back wall of the arcade: they were supposed to have teaching functions, to demonstrate scientific measurement to the public, but they were judged to be out of place with respect to the value of the monumental loggia and were soon removed. Finally, a curiosity: on the walls are two commemorative inscriptions that recall the adoption of the common calendar, which occurred in Florence in 1750 and all the stops along the path of unification of Italy.",

      Title: "Ponte Vecchio (Old bridge)",
      Text: "Ponte Vecchio Bridge - “Old Bridge” in Italian - is the most famous bridge in Florence and undoubtedly one of the city’s most illustrious landmarks. It is an incredibly breathtaking sight when seen from afar, and even more so when you walk across it! \n\nIt spans the narrowest point of the Arno River, and doesn’t really look like a bridge at all for the numerous overhanging shops, whose glittering treasures delight the visitors’ gaze as they pass by. The bridge - entrance point to the city of Florence from the Cassia road - is made of wood and stone and probably dates back to the Roman era. But the river continued to prevail, and until the 1300s the bridge underwent at least two reconstructions due to the floods. \n\nThe last transformation was revolutionary because, unlike the Roman technique, it was held up by segmental arches that prevent the road surface from bowing excessively. It is thanks to this architectural feat that the bridge has been preserved in all its splendor to the present day! \n\nPonte Vecchio’s uniqueness lies in the fact that it is not only a functional structure for crossing the river, but is also a road, a market place and piazza that is developed in a chaotic fashion over the centuries, defying the impetuous river and even the laws of physics!",
